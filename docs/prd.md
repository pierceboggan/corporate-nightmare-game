# Corporate Nightmare

## 1. Product Overview
- **Core Value Proposition**: A humorous and engaging twist on the classic Snake game, where players navigate through a corporate-themed environment, avoiding obstacles and collecting items to grow their "corporate influence."
- **Target Audience**: Casual gamers, office workers, and anyone looking for a lighthearted take on corporate culture.

## 2. Functional Specifications
2.1 The snake's head will feature a customizable picture of the player (default: a picture of the user).
2.2 Players navigate through levels filled with corporate-themed obstacles such as:
   - LT (Leadership Team) reviews
   - OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)
   - Endless meetings
   - "Reply All" email chains
   - Office politics (e.g., gossip clouds)
   - Budget cuts (represented as scissors or red lines)
2.3 Collectible items to grow the snake could include:
   - Coffee cups (energy boost)
   - Office supplies (e.g., staplers, pens)
   - Promotions (e.g., briefcases, ties)
2.4 Levels will increase in difficulty with more obstacles and faster movement.
2.5 Add power-ups such as:
   - "Work From Home" (temporary invincibility)
   - "Team Collaboration" (clears obstacles for a short time)
   - "Corporate Retreat" (slows down the game temporarily)
2.6 Include a leaderboard to track high scores.
2.7 Add humorous sound effects and corporate jargon pop-ups (e.g., "Let's circle back on that").

## 3. Technical Specifications
- **Architecture**: The game will be built using the MonoGame framework for cross-platform compatibility.
- **Language**: C#
- **Platforms**: Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux) with potential for future mobile expansion.
- **Graphics**: 2D sprite-based visuals with a corporate aesthetic.
- **Audio**: Background music and sound effects using open-source libraries.

## 4. MVP Scope

- Snake head customization with a default picture.
- Basic collectibles (e.g., coffee cups and office supplies).
- Simple leaderboard to track high scores.

## Questions and Suggestions
1. Should the game include a storyline or progression system (e.g., climbing the corporate ladder)?
2. Would you like to include multiplayer or co-op modes in the future?
3. Should we explore additional mechanics like penalties for hitting obstacles (e.g., losing length or speed)?
4. Consider adding seasonal or event-based themes (e.g., holiday parties, end-of-quarter crunch).
5. Would you like to integrate social sharing features for high scores?
